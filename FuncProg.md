# Functional Programming Refreseher

Goals:
* Understand Functional Programming, train my brain to think functional but only when it is needed.
* Use scala natively with Spark. Possibly expose reusable capabilities to be used with my stack
* Make a proper Azure CosmosDb example with spark

### Functional Programming Principles using Scala

* [Variance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/dnreZ/lecture-4-4-variance-optional) [x]
* [Decomposition](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/8ZaPo/lecture-4-5-decomposition) [x]
* [Pattern Matching](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/lecture/cdHAM/lecture-4-6-pattern-matching) [x]
